# Documentation of the trained directory

## What ist stored in this directory
This directory holds all trained alpha-zero models and their Containers

## Where to put my trained AI
To add a new alpha-zero instance, create a new directory in `/app/backend/alpha-zero/trained/<name of the game>`. Replace `<name of the game>` with the name of game the instance want to add is trained for. A TicTacToe instance should therefore be added inside the directory `/app/.../trained/tic-tac-toe`.
